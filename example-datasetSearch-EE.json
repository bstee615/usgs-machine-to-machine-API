A fundamental use of ASAS data is to characterize and understand the directional variability in solar energy scattered by various land surface cover types (e.g., crops, forests, prairie grass, snow, or bare soil). The sensor's Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function determines the variation in the reflectance of a surface as a function of both the view zenith angle and solar illumination angle.\r\n\r\nThe ASAS sensor is a hyperspectral, multiangle, airborne remote sensing instrument maintained and operated by the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The ASAS instrument is mounted on the underside of either NASA C-130 or NASA P-3 aircraft and is capable of off-nadir pointing from approximately 70 degrees forward to 55 degrees aft along the direction of flight. The aircraft is flown at an altitude of 5000 - 6000 meters (approximately 16,000 - 20,000 ft.).\r\n\r\nData in the ASAS collection primarily cover areas over the continental United States, but some ASAS data are also available over areas in Canada and western Africa. The ASAS data were collected between 1988 and 1994.\r\n",

Researchers at the USGS EROS Center utilize data gathered by satellite sensors to track seasonal changes in vegetation.  The satellite sensors that provide the raw data are the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites.  The satellite data are initially transformed into Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values.  AVHRR NDVI provide the foundation for the phenology metrics.  Time-series NDVI can be summarized and analyzed to produce nine key phenological indicators that represent a complete growing season.  These data represent a powerful tool for documenting plant life-cycle trends over time and detecting the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe complete set of phenological metrics are as follows: 1. Start of Season Time (SOST): starting time of the onset of the growing season (in day of the year). 2. Start of Season NDVI (SOSN): NDVI value at the starting time of the onset of the growing season (unitless- based on NDVI units). 3. End of Season Time (EOST): ending time of the growing season (in day of the year). 4. End of Season NDVI (EOSN): NDVI value at the ending time of the growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 5. Maximum Time (MAXT): the day of the year when the NDVI reaches its maximum during the growing season (in day of the year). 6. Maximum NDVI (MAXN): the highest (or peak) value in NDVI observed in a growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 7. Duration (DUR): the length of the growing season-the time between the start of season and end of season (in number of days). 8. Amplitude (AMP): the difference between the Maximum NDVI and NDVI at the day of start of season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 9.

The global mosaics are centered on 1975, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010, and consist of data acquired from five sensors: Operational Land Imager, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, Thematic Mapper, Multispectral Scanner, and Advanced Land Imager.  This newest version combines all of the GLS data into one collection which has all of the combined collections.  The GLS datasets have been widely used in land-cover and land-use change studies at local, regional, and global scales.  This study evaluates the GLS datasets with respect to their spatial coverage, temporal consistency, geodetic accuracy, radiometric calibration consistency, image completeness, extent of cloud contamination, and residual gaps.  The datasets have been improved in order to give spatial continuity across all decadal collections.  Most of the imagery (85%) having cloud cover of less than 10%, the acquisition years clustered much more tightly around their target years, better co-registration relative to GLS-2000, and better radiometric absolute calibration.  Probably, the most significant impediment to scientific use of the datasets is the variability of image phenology (i.e., acquisition day of year).  This collection provides end-users with an assessment of the quality of the GLS datasets for specific applications, and where possible, suggestions for mitigating their deficiencies.",

Images are acquired in 14 spectral bands using three separate telescopes and sensor systems. These include three visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands with a spatial resolution of 15 meters (m), six short-wave-infrared (SWIR) bands with a spatial resolution of 30m, and five thermal infrared (TIR) bands that have a spatial resolution of 90 m. VNIR Band3 also is acquired using a backward-looking telescope, thus providing along-track stereo coverage from which high-quality digital elevation models (DEMs) are generated as one of a suite of ASTER standard data products. ASTER DEM standard data products are produced with 30m postings, and have Z accuracies generally between 10 m and 25 m root mean square error (RMSE).The development project of the ASTER Ground Data System (ASTER GDS) began in fiscal year 1994. The ASTER Global DEM (GDEM) was released to the public on June 29, 2009.",

Images are acquired in 14 spectral bands using three separate telescopes and sensor systems. These include three visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands with a spatial resolution of 15 meters (m), six short-wave-infrared (SWIR) bands with a spatial resolution of 30m, and five thermal infrared (TIR) bands that have a spatial resolution of 90 m. VNIR Band3 also is acquired using a backward-looking telescope, thus providing along-track stereo coverage from which high-quality digital elevation models (DEMs) are generated as one of a suite of ASTER standard data products. ASTER DEM standard data products are produced with 30m postings, and have Z accuracies generally between 10 m and 25 m root mean square error (RMSE).The development project of the ASTER Ground Data System (ASTER GDS) began in fiscal year 1994. The ASTER Global DEM (GDEM) was released to the public on June 29, 2009.",

Several types of mapping cameras and film formats have been used to acquire over 300,000 frames of photography since 1946, with annual acquisitions since 1980.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the USARC photography is panchromatic black and white taken with three Fairchild cameras, each with a metrogon lens resulting in trimetrogon photographs (left oblique, vertical, and right oblique photographs). More recent acquisitions include natural color and color-infrared, archived mainly on 9-inch film. Fewer than 30,000 frames (less than 10 percent) of the photography are archived on 70-mm film. Spatial resolutions vary as a function of photographic scale, which ranges from 1:1,000 to 1:64,000.\r\n\r\nThe original aerial film negatives were store at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The USGS archives most of the film taken over Antarctica what was held in the United States. Original film rolls acquired more than forty years ago became the responsibility of the National Archives, once scanned the rolls were sent to College Park, MD for storage.\r\n\r\nThe USGS is responsible for maintaining the USARC, which is a repository and distribution site for all cartographic materials covering Antarctica that are produced by the United States and other participating USARC nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Researchers at the USGS EROS Center utilize data gathered by satellite sensors to track seasonal changes in vegetation.  The satellite sensors that provide the raw data are the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) carried aboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra and Aqua satellites.  The satellite data are initially transformed into Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values.  eMODIS NDVI provide the foundation for the phenology metrics.  Time-series NDVI can be summarized and analyzed to produce nine key phenological indicators.  These data represent a powerful tool for documenting plant life-cycle trends and detecting the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.\r\nThe complete set of phenological metrics are as follows: 1. Start of Season Time (SOST): starting time of the onset of the growing season (in day of the year). 2. Start of Season NDVI (SOSN): NDVI value at the starting time of the onset of the growing season (unitless- based on NDVI units). 3. End of Season Time (EOST): ending time of the growing season (in day of the year). 4. End of Season NDVI (EOSN): NDVI value at the ending time of the growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 5. Maximum Time (MAXT): the day of the year when the NDVI reaches its maximum during the growing season (in day of the year). 6. Maximum NDVI (MAXN): the highest (or peak) value in NDVI observed in a growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 7. Duration (DUR): the length of the growing season-the time between the start of season and end of season (in number of days). 8. Amplitude (AMP): the difference between the Maximum NDVI and NDVI at the day of start of season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 9. Time Integrated NDVI (TIN): the cumulative value of NDVI from the start to the end of the growing season (unitless-based on accumulated NDVI unit",

OrbView-3 collected one meter panchromatic (black and white) and four meter multispectral (color) imagery at a swath width of 8 km for both sensors.  One meter imagery enables more accurate viewing and mapping of houses, automobiles and aircraft, and makes it possible to create precise digital products.  Four meter multispectral imagery provides color and near infrared (NIR) information to further characterize cities, rural areas and undeveloped land from space.  Imagery from the OrbView-3 satellite complements existing geographic information system (GIS) data for commercial, environmental and national security customers.  OrbView-3 orbits 470 km above the Earth in a sun-synchronous polar orbit while collecting imagery of the Earth's surface at one meter resolution in the Panchromatic (black and white) mode, or at four meter resolution in the Multispectral (color) mode with a three day repeat cycle.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center received 179,981 OrbView-3 image segments from GeoEye with no restrictions.  The data were delivered in Basic Enhanced (Level 1B) radiometrically corrected format.  The product files include satellite telemetry data, rational functions, post-processed Ground Sample Distance (GPS) at nadir data, and sufficient metadata for rigorous triangulation.\r\n\r\nThe data in this collection were acquired between September 2003 and March 2007, both multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) sensor.

The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 NAD83).  The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overage ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points.  The overage is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks.  The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns).  Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south.  The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255.  The standard, uncompressed gray scale DOQ format contains an ASCII header followed by a series of 8-bit image data lines.  The keyword-based, ASCII header may vary in the number of data entries.  The header is affixed to the beginning of the image and is composed of strings of 80 characters with an asterisk (*) as character 79 and an invisible newline character as character 80.  Each keyword string contains information for either identification, display, or registration of the image.  Additional strings of blanks are added to the header so that the length of a header line equals the number of bytes in a line of image data.  The header line will be equal in length to the length of an image line.  If the sum of the byte count of the header is less than the sample count of one DOQ image line, then the remainder of the header is padded with the requisite number of 80 character blank entries, each terminated with an asterisk and newline character.",

The initial RBV sensor configuration used three independent cameras, each sensing a different spectral wavelength (0.48 to 0.83).  Landsat 1 &amp; 2 RBV data were recorded to 70 mm black &amp; white film rolls at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and delivered to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center for archiving and user distribution.  The RBV sensor utilized vidicon tube instruments containing an electron gun that read images from a photoconductive faceplate similar to television cameras.  The data stream received from the satellite was analog-to-digital preprocessed to correct for radiometric and geometric errors.  The RBV system was redesigned for Landsat 3 to use a two camera configuration mounted side by side that acquired four sub-scenes within the field of view of a Multispectral Scanner (MSS) scene.  The Landsat 3 RBV spatial resolution is 40 meters.  Landsat 3 data were also recorded to 70 mm film until the EROS Digital Imagery Processing System (EDIPS) became operational in 1979.  EROS Laser Beam Recorders (LBR's) recorded MSS and RBV data at 28 micron to 9-inch film rolls and the imagery was chipped up for archival storage and remains a viable archive backup to the digital MSS archive.  However, all of the RBV digital archive data were purged for lack of computer compatible reasons.  Today, the RBV 70 mm and 9-inch film sources are maintained in the USGS EROS archive and are accessible through EarthExplorer as an on-demand film scanning product.  RBV images that are scanned are used to generate browse and archive TIFF products that remain as no-cost options for all users.  The RBV raw TIFF products are not georeferenced.  They are black &amp; white images that faithfully represent the Landsat RBV film archive as it exists today.\r\n",

Coverage over the conterminous United States includes both black-and-white (BW) and color infrared (CIR) aerial photographs. Film type and extent of coverage were determined by available funds and operational requirements. The NAPP program, which was operational from 1987 to 2007, consists of more than 1.3 million images. Photographs were acquired on 9-inch film and were centered over quarters of USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles.\r\n\r\nPhotographs are available as medium resolution digital images in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).

Consequently, imagery can be obtained either day or night. Since microwave energy penetrates most clouds, SLAR can be used to prepare image maps of cloud-covered areas. Data are X-band synthetic aperture radar (horizontally transmitted, horizontally received) with the exception of some test sites. Since the radar signal is transmitted at a depressional angle below the horizontal plane in which the aircraft is flying, the signal strikes the terrain at an oblique angle, and the surficial expression of the geologic structure may thus be enhanced. The topographic expression of some surface features, such as subtle faults and folds, may be more clearly seen on radar imagery than on conventional aerial photographs or satellite images.",

The new dataset consists of a detailed and highly accurate elevation model incorporating the best available multi-source topographic and bathymetric elevation data.  The Coastal National Elevation Database (CoNED) Project - topobathymetric digital elevation models (TBDEMs) integrate hundreds of different data sources including topographic and bathymetric LiDAR point clouds, hydrographic surveys, side-scan sonar surveys, and multibeam surveys obtained from multiple agencies.  The LiDAR and bathymetry surveys were sorted and prioritized based on survey date, accuracy, spatial distribution, and point density to develop a model based on the best available elevation data.  Because bathymetric data is typically referenced to tidal datums (such as Mean High Water or Mean Sea Level), all tidally-referenced heights were transformed into orthometric heights that are normally used for mapping elevation on land (based on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988).",

More than 860,000 images of Earth's surface, collected between 1960 and 1972, were declassified with the issuance of this Executive Order. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) was given the responsibility for the original film and provide access to a duplicate copy for public viewing of the film. The USGS was also provided a dupe copy to support science products. Both NARA and the USGS provide access and product support for Declass-1 collection.\r\n\r\nOnline requests for these data can be placed via the EarthExplorer interactive query system. EarthExplorer contains metadata and online samples of Earth science data. With EarthExplorer, you may review metadata, determine product availability, and place online requests for products.\r\n\r\nMore than 40 percent of the imagery contains significant cloud cover. The use of browse imagery gives the user the opportunity to review a reduced spatial resolution image to determine whether or not the area of interest is covered and is or is not obscured by clouds.\r\n",

The capsules or buckets were de-orbited and retrieved by aircraft while the capsules parachuted to earth. The exposed film was developed and the images were analyzed for a range of military applications.\r\n\r\nThe KH-7 surveillance system was a high resolution imaging system that was operational from July 1963 to June 1967. Approximately 18,000 black-and-white images and 230 color images are available from the 38 missions flown during this program. Key features for this program were larger area of coverage and improved ground resolution. The cameras acquired imagery in continuous lengthwise sweeps of the terrain. KH-7 images are 9 inches wide, vary in length from 4 inches to 500 feet long, and have a resolution of 2 to 4 feet.\r\n\r\nThe KH-9 mapping program was operational from March 1973 to October 1980 and was designed to support mapping requirements and exact positioning of geographical points for the military. This was accomplished by using image overlap for stereo coverage and by using a camera system with a reseau grid to correct image distortion. The KH-9 framing cameras produced 9 x 18 inch imagery at a resolution of 20-30 feet. Approximately 29,000 mapping images were acquired from 12 missions.\r\n\r\nThe images have variable scales and quality.  Cloud cover is common.  The digital products are produced from a duplicate negative film source.  More than 40 percent of the imagery contains significant cloud cover.  The use of browse imagery gives the user the opportunity to review a reduced resolution image to determine if the area of interest is covered and to check for cloud cover.

During 1980's, 75% of state of Alaska was mapped using Landsat satellite data.  During the 1990's, (i) land cover characteristics database concept was demonstrated, (ii) Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium was formed with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and US Forest Service (USFS), (iii) Global Land Cover Characteristics database was completed, and (iv) land cover and vegetation databases of the U.S. using Landsat TM data were completed.  During 2000-2002, a forest canopy density map was produced as a part of Forest Resources Assessment 2000 for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and MRLC-2001 dataset was released.  In 2003, land cover mapping of North America was carried out as a contribution to the Global Land Cover 2000 project being implemented by the Joint Research Center (JRC) of European Commission (EC).\r\n\r\n",

The new model has been generated at three separate resolutions (horizontal post spacing) of 30 arc-seconds (about 1 kilometer), 15 arc-seconds (about 500 meters), and 7.5 arc-seconds (about 250 meters).  This new product suite provides global coverage of all land areas from latitude 84 degrees N to 56 degrees S for most products, and coverage from 84 degrees N to 90 degrees S for several products.  Some areas, namely Greenland and Antarctica, do not have data available at the 15- and 7.5-arc-second resolutions because the input source data do not support that level of detail.  An additional advantage of the new multi-resolution global model over GTOPO30 is that seven new raster elevation products are available at each resolution.  The new elevation products have been produced using the following aggregation methods: minimum elevation, maximum elevation, mean elevation, median elevation, standard deviation of elevation, systematic subsample, and breakline emphasis.  The systematic subsample product is defined using a nearest neighbor resampling function, whereby an actual elevation value is extracted from the input source at the center of a processing window.  Most vertical heights in GMTED2010 are referenced to the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM 96) geoid (NGA, 2010).  In addition to the elevation products, detailed spatially referenced metadata containing attribute fields such as coordinates, projection information, and raw source elevation statistics have been generated on a tile-by-tile basis for all the input datasets that constitute the global elevation model. GMTED2010 is based on data derived from 11 raster-based elevation sources.",

The goal of the project is the development of a globally consistent hydrologic derivative data set. The effort has been led by U.S.G.S. scientists in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme/Global Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID) located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the HYDRO1k database was made possible by the completion of the 30 arc-second digital elevation model at EROS in 1996, entitled GTOPO30. This data set, with its nominal cell size of 1 km, has been and will continue to be applied by many scientists and researchers to hydrologic and land form studies. Inevitably, these studies require development, at a minimum, of a standard suite of derivative products.\r\nThe HYDRO1k package provides, for each continent, a suite of six raster and two vector data sets. These data sets cover many of the common derivative products used in hydrologic analysis. The raster data sets are the hydrologically correct DEM, derived flow directions, flow accumulations, slope, aspect, and a compound topographic (wetness) index. The derived streamlines and basins are distributed as vector data sets.\r\n",

In a project funded by the USGS Climate and Land Use Change and Core Science Systems Mission Areas, 13,000 photos distributed across 44 Level III Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ecoregions are currently being disseminated to the public.

The USGS is under agreement with NGA and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to distribute the C-band data.  SRTM utilized dual Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR-C) and dual X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) configured as a baseline interferometer to successfully collect data over 80 per cent of the Earth's land surface, everything between 60 degrees North and 56 degrees South latitude.\r\nGroups of scientists have worked on algorithms to fill the voids of the original SRTM data.  Two datasets offer global coverage void-filled SRTM data at full resolution quality assessment.  The void-filled SRTM data from are high quality at full SRTM resolution, but coverage is limited to areas of high mountain void incidence, and some areas north of 60 degrees of latitude.\r\n",

MAIAC is a new advanced algorithm which uses time series analysis and a combination of pixel- and image-based processing to improve accuracy of cloud detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction. The underlying physical idea behind MAIAC is simple: because surface changes slowly in time compared to aerosols and clouds given the daily rate of global MODIS observations, the focus is on extensive characterization of the surface background in order to improve all stages of MAIAC processing. MAIAC starts with gridding MODIS measurements (L1B data) to a fixed grid at 1km resolution in order to observe the same grid cell over time and work with polar-orbiting observations as if they were geostationary.",

The three components are each stored in separate layers so they can be used independently to look at a particular type of ground cover or collectively to look at the entire surface. VCF products provide a continuous, quantitative portrayal of land surface cover at 250 meter pixel resolution, and hence, are widely used in environmental modeling and monitoring applications.",

The data are available annually from 2000 to 2015. MOD44W Version 6 is derived using a decision tree classifier trained with MODIS data and validated with the Version 5 MOD44W data product.  A series of masks are applied to address known issues caused by terrain shadow, burn scars, cloudiness, or ice cover in oceans.  A primary improvement in Version 6 is the generation of time series data, rather than a simple static representation of water, given that water bodies fluctuate in size and location over time due to both natural and anthropogenic causes.  Provided in each MOD44W Version 6 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file are layers for land, water, no data, and an associated per pixel quality assurance (QA) layer that provides users with information on the determination of water.",

The word fiducial carries multiple meanings with regard to the GFL. Fiducials are marks or points of reference applied to images to present a fixed standard of reference, so in the GFL they refer to the identification of a place on the Earth. The term fiducial may also be interpreted to refer to a long-term trust, where one may be holding something in trust for another. Both references aptly apply, as the GFL maintains a long-term record of data over specific places on the Earth to be available for scientific investigations. Fiducial sites are associated with Earth processes and environmentally sensitive areas that are being monitored so that scientists can better understand and model the dynamic systems and changes that are occurring. The sites are located around the globe and are distributed among environmental topics and processes within five major disciplines: Ocean Processes; Ice and Snow Dynamics; Atmospheric Processes; Land Use/Land Cover; and Geologic Processes.

The VCF5KYR data product is derived from a bagged linear model algorithm using Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR V4) data compiled from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is the ratio of the area of the vertical projection of green vegetation above ground to the total area, capturing the horizontal distribution and density of vegetation on the Earth's surface. FVC is a primary means for measuring global forest cover change and is a key parameter for a variety of environmental and climate-related applications, including carbon land surface models and biomass measurements. The three bands included in each VCF5KYR Version 1 GeoTIFF are: percent of tree cover, non-tree vegetation, and bare ground.
